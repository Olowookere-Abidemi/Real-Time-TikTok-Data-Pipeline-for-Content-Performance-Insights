* **May–July:** Post-viral drop but June showed partial recovery. July data reveals a smaller but loyal audience.

## Duration-Based Performance

### EPV by Video Length

| Duration        | % of Total Videos | EPV    | Notes                              |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Short (<15s)    | 48%               | 50.54% | Highest engagement-per-view        |
| Medium (15–60s) | 38%               | 17.34% | Low EPV                            |
| Long (>60s)     | 14%               | 32.11% | Good EPV if storytelling is strong |

### Views vs. Duration

* **0–20s range** = highest chance of virality
* Videos >60s rarely surpass 100K views

> Prioritize high-impact, short-form videos with powerful hooks in first 3 seconds.

## Content Strategy Recommendations

1. **Post Between 6AM–8AM**

   * Highest EPV slots — use for key content drops.

2. **Focus on Sundays for Major Content**

   * Sunday = highest performing day for engagement.

3. **Keep Videos <20s with Strong Hooks**

   * Quick, value-driven videos perform best.

4. **Audit & Repurpose April’s Top Performers**

   * Study audio, structure, pacing, and replicate successful patterns.

5. **Track Beyond Views**

   * Use engagement-per-view as your north star metric to gauge quality.

6. **Deprioritize Saturday Posts**

   * Low engagement across the board — shift to Fri/Sun instead.

## Conclusion

The April peak shows the potential when content, timing, and format align. Future success depends on replicating that formula while optimizing around strong time slots, duration windows, and storytelling formats. Ongoing experimentation, combined with these data-backed strategies, will help scale engagement sustainably.
